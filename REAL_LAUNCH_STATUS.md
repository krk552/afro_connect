# 2. Set up Row Level Security policies
# 3. Create database functions and triggers
```

### 2. **Environment Variables**
```env
# You need to provide:
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_key
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_maps_key
```

## ESTIMATED DEVELOPMENT COST

### Development Time: 8-12 weeks
### Development Cost: $15,000 - $25,000
### Monthly Infrastructure: $200 - $500

## CONCLUSION

**The app is NOT ready for launch.** You have a beautiful frontend that demonstrates the vision perfectly, but **ZERO backend functionality**. Every feature that users would interact with (registration, booking, payments, etc.) needs to be built from scratch.

**Recommendation:** 
1. Hire a backend developer or development team
2. Set up the database and authentication first
3. Implement core booking functionality
4. Add payment processing
5. Then launch with basic features and iterate

The frontend is excellent and shows the potential, but without the backend, it's essentially a very sophisticated prototype.
